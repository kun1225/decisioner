# Appendix E: Example Decision

## Example Decision

**Title:** Should I learn Rust in 2024?

**Description:** Considering investing 2-3 months to learn Rust for systems programming.

**Context:** Current stack is TypeScript. Interested in performance-critical code. Rust jobs increasing.

**Hypotheses:**

1. Learning Rust will make me better at memory management (Confidence: 80%)
2. I can ship a side project in Rust within 3 months (Confidence: 45%)
3. Rust knowledge will be relevant to my career in 2 years (Confidence: 60%)

**Expected Outcome:** If I learn Rust:

- Should be able to understand systems-level code
- Might contribute to a Rust OSS project
- Better mental model for performance

**Final Choice (on freeze):** Yes, will start with Rustlings

**Review (6 months later):**

- Outcome: Completed Rustlings, built a CLI tool. Did not ship side project.
- H1: Confirmed - much better understanding of ownership
- H2: Wrong - took 5 months and still not "shipped"
- H3: Too early to tell
- Lesson: I consistently underestimate learning curves for new paradigms
